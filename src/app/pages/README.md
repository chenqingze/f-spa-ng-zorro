### Feature Modules/ Pages Modules

Applications commonly have multiple Feature Modules. Depending on the size of your application, you
may have A LOT of
Feature Modules. Breaking things up into domain-specific areas can help in the long run for
development.

> Lazy loading is the main reason to break up your application into Feature Modules. You can load
> them as needed. If you
> want to learn more about lazy loading, check out the Angular documentation
> on [Lazy Loading Feature Modules](https://angular.io/guide/lazy-loading-ngmodules).

Now you have a better understanding of how to separate your different modules in Angular. For more
on modules, check out
the [Angular Introduction to Modules](https://angular.io/guide/architecture-modules).
